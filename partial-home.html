              Thankfully there are many resources in the Kingston and Queen’s community but the problem is that taking the steps to reach out can be difficult. We envision Aliva to be an app that any student with a smartphone or tablet will download upon their arrival to Queen’s that they can have on hand throughout their time at Queen’s.  This app will get users in touch with professionals and allow them to get the help/resources they need. When someone is in distress they may not have a clear mind and they may not think to Google what help is available, but if the app is already on their phone all they have to do is open it. The goal is to make help accessible and even easier to get.
