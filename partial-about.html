Aliva will be simple in format and easy to use. The main difference that Aliva holds against other suicide prevention apps is that the user will be able to instantly connect with someone else in real time, 24/7, depending on what they believe they need, without having to leave the comfort of their residence or having to make a phone call. We hope to partner with KGH, Queen’s Wellness Services, JackProject.org, Frontenac Community Mental Health Services 24/7 crisis line, Queen’s Campus Security, and the Queen’s Peer Support Center.

Before beginning to chat, users will input their phone number or an email to have in case the connection is lost, and for follow up purposes (if the individual wishes to be contacted again/for safety). As well, there will be a notice that appears stating that if the user feels like their life is in danger they should call 911 immediately (and then an option to skip this screen and continue if they just need to talk with someone).

 We will allow users to gauge what kind of assistance they need by having a choice of who they would like to speak to from the 24/7 mobile crisis team. If we have student volunteers on our team, we would only ask for their assistance during the Peer Support Center business hours. We would also only having willing and wanting volunteers who would want to take on extra, intensive training from professionals to help. Student team members would not counsel but would instead refer app users to another professional that was available on the app. We wish to have members from the crisis line who are already staffed 24/7 to help us during off hours. Each team member will have a profile with a short biography/summary of who they are and what they do. We want to establish a connection between app users and the helping team by having real, authentic individuals who have gone through difficult times as well. This will also allow for a stronger fight for battling against the stigmatization of mental illnesses and to allow users to know that they are not alone.  
It will work like an instant messenger platform; if someone is online they will be at the top of the list with a green/blue light next to their name, and if someone is offline their profile will be greyed out but still viewable. 
<p><p></p></p>

Before beginning the conversation users will be able to scroll/swipe through the list to pick someone who they would prefer to talk to. Conversations will be structured, but we will give the user the freedom to share their thoughts/feelings/needs. Team members will ask prompting questions to determine the level of care the user requires and then refer them to all their options depending on what is best suited for the user.

Although KidsHelpPhone has an online chat function available, it is only for people who are 20 and under. We hope to focus on students in post-secondary institutions, specifically Queen’s. If it is successful, we imagine it being able to expand to other campuses across Ontario, and then perhaps even across Canada.
